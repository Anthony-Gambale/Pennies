Findings so far
 1. If S1 is a permutation of S2, next(S1) is a permutation of next(S2)
 2. k>1 k-cycles trivially exist when the total number of pennies is not a triangular number
 3. For a triangular number of total pennies, there is one unique 1-cycle state

Research Questions
 1. For a triangular number of total pennies, do k>1 k-cycles exist?
 2. For a triangular number of total pennies, do all states eventually reach the 1-cycle?

Ideas
 1. Is there meaning to reducing the space to equivalence classes up to permutation? See finding 1.
 2. Use a Java program to search for k>1 k-cycles.
 3. Is the 2nd research question equivalent to the Collatz conjecture?
